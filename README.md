# Pixel_NASA : Stellar Variability Investigation in VR 

### Objective :

"Stellar Variability Investigation in VR" is exactly what it is. Created a VR environment where anyone, including those without no prior understanding of astronomy, can learn about the study of stellar variability using the most well-known lightcurves. Initially a lot of user-friendly video courses with interactive code are available. The second phase retrieved all the necessary data from the NASA server and displayed it in a style that was user-friendly for beginners, including a flux vs. time graph, peridogram, live video simulation, and basic information. Now it is up to the user to use prior knowledge to determine whether they have discovered an exoplanet or unique variability pattern.

#### Timeline:
- Day 1 (Oct 1): Study about basic and think about idea + Basic Flask server setup => connect with unity
- Day 2 (Oct 2): Scene design and resource hunt, wrap it up + Github setup

### Future Improvements :
- Host server to cloud services like AWS or GCP rather using local Flask server.
- Look into useful visualization tools for studying stellar variability, such as graphs and simulations.(contact any expert)
- Better learning resources(videos) and gamify learning experience 
- Skybox Update :  1:1 corelation with real star coordinates(astropy + Skycord) and texture from telescope(.fits), add cameralook at motion
