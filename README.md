# Pixel_NASA : Stellar Variability Investigation in VR 

### Objective :
```
"Stellar Variability Investigation in VR" is exactly what it is. Created a VR environment where anyone, including those without no prior understanding of astronomy, can learn about the study of stellar variability using the most well-known lightcurves. Initially a lot of user-friendly video courses with interactive code are available. The second phase retrieved all the necessary data from the NASA server and displayed it in a style that was user-friendly for beginners, including a flux vs. time graph, peridogram, live video simulation, and basic information. Now it is up to the user to use prior knowledge to determine whether they have discovered an exoplanet or unique variability pattern.
