# Pixel_NASA : Stellar Variability Investigation in VR 

### Objective :

"Stellar Variability Investigation in VR" sounds precisely like what it is. Anyone, including those without any prior knowledge of astronomy, can learn about the study of star variability using the most well-known technique called "light curves" inspection in a virtual reality environment that I have constructed. First-time users are given access to a variety of user-friendly video tutorials with interactive code that aid in understanding the complexities of research. Users are given the essential data from the NASA server in the second section, which has been preprocessed in a Flask server and shown in a way that is user-friendly for beginners. This data includes a flux vs. time graph, periodogram, live video simulation, and basic information. The user must now make a determination based on past knowledge as to whether they have found an exoplanet or a special variability pattern.

#### Timeline:
- Day 1 (Oct 1): Study about basic and think about idea + Basic Flask server setup => connect with unity
- Day 2 (Oct 2): Scene design and resource hunt, wrap it up + Github setup

### Future Improvements :
- Host server to cloud services like AWS or GCP rather using local Flask server.
- Look into useful visualization tools for studying stellar variability, such as graphs and simulations.(contact any expert)
- Better learning resources(videos) and gamify learning experience 
- Skybox Update :  1:1 corelation with real star coordinates(astropy + Skycord) and texture from telescope(.fits), add cameralook at motion
